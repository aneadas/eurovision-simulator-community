# Eurovision Song Contest Simulator - Community Edition

Welcome to the community-driven Eurovision Song Contest Simulator! This project allows you to create and run your own Eurovision-style song contests with detailed settings and dynamic results.

This project is a continuation and revival of the original Eurovision Simulator created by **u/Successful_Sky7328**. We're excited to build upon their fantastic foundational work and bring new features to the Eurovision fan community!

**Live Simulator:** [WSTAW TUTAJ LINK DO DZIAŁAJĄCEGO SYMULATORA]

## About The Project

This simulator is designed for Eurovision fans who love to play with data, odds, and "what if" scenarios. It's more focused on the numbers and simulation logic rather than heavy animations or complex visual design (though we're always open to improvements!).

As u/Successful_Sky7328 originally envisioned, this tool is for the community, and we're thrilled to keep that spirit alive.

## Features

* **Wide Country Selection:** Choose from a comprehensive list of countries that have participated in Eurovision.
* **Custom Participants:** Add your own custom countries with unique names, codes, and flags.
* **Odds & Genres:** Set base odds (jury and televote) and assign genres to each participating country. These factors influence the voting simulation.
* **Flexible Auto-Qualifiers (AQ):** Manually select which countries automatically qualify for the final (up to 10 if 27+ countries are participating).
* **Semi-Finals & Grand Final:** The simulator can run contests with one or two semi-finals (if more than 26 countries are selected) leading to a Grand Final.
* **Dynamic Voting Simulation:** Experience an interactive reveal of jury and televote points in the Grand Final.
* **Detailed Charts:** View comprehensive voting charts for jury and televoting for each show (Semi-Finals and Grand Final).
* **NEW! Scenario Saving & Loading:**
    * Save your entire simulation setup (selected countries, odds, genres, custom contestants, global settings like genre likeability, voting system) to a local `.json` file.
    * Load your saved scenarios anytime to pick up where you left off or re-run a favorite setup.
    * Specify custom filenames when saving your scenarios for better organization.
* **Customizable Settings:** Adjust various parameters like genre likeability, voting system (with or without jury in semis), odds ranges, and more.

## Contributing & "House Rules"

We are excited to have this project grow with the help of the community! If you have ideas, want to report a bug, or contribute code, that's fantastic!

Here's how we'd like to collaborate:

1.  **Ideas & Suggestions:**
    * We're planning to use a **Trello Board** (or a similar tool - link to be provided soon) to track ideas, features in progress, and bugs. This will be the primary place to suggest new features or report issues.
    * Before starting work on a new feature, please create a card on Trello or discuss it with the current maintainers (currently [Twoja Nazwa Użytkownika] and u/Successful_Sky7328 if they are actively involved). This helps ensure we're on the same page and that the feature fits the project's vision.

2.  **Making Changes to the Code:**
    * If you're making changes, please **comment your code clearly**, especially new functions or complex logic.
    * When adding or modifying sections, it's helpful to add a comment like:
        `// Added by [Your Username] - YYYY-MM-DD - Feature: Brief description`
        `// Modified by [Your Username] - YYYY-MM-DD - Bugfix: Brief description`
    * For **minor changes or bug fixes**, if a quick check-in isn't possible, it's generally okay to implement them, provided they are well-commented and the Trello board/other maintainers are updated soon after.
    * For **major new features or significant refactoring**, please discuss them on Trello or with the maintainers *before* starting extensive work. This helps avoid duplicate efforts and ensures architectural consistency.

3.  **Pull Requests (If using GitHub/GitLab etc.):**
    * If we move to a platform like GitHub, please make changes in a separate branch and submit a pull request.
    * Ensure your code is tested (even manually) before submitting.
    * Describe your changes clearly in the pull request.

4.  **Be Respectful:** This is a community project built on enthusiasm for Eurovision. Let's keep all interactions positive and constructive.
